# bystander-effect-model

Project Goal: 

Create an agent-based model simulating the bystander effect as observed in real-life situations to be a visual representation of how the individual reactions of bystanders influence the magnitude of the bystander effect.


<!--Key Patterns: 

  1. a decrease in interveners as the number of bystanders increases
  2. an increased likelihood of intervention if the bystander has a social relationship with a conflict party member
  3. an increased likelihood of intervention if the bystander is a man
  4. an increased likelihood of escalatory intervention if the bystander is a man
  5. an increased likelihood of intervention if the bystander is within close spatial proximity of the event
